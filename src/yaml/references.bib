Exploiting a regression discontinuity design for close elections, we find that municipalities with a new party in office experience upheavals in the municipal bureaucracy: new personnel are appointed across multiple service sectors, and at both managerial and non-managerial levels. In education, the increase in the replacement rate of personnel in schools controlled by the municipal government is accompanied by test scores that are 0.05\textendash 0.08 standard deviations lower. In contrast, turnover of the mayor's party does not impact local (non-municipal) schools. These findings suggest that political turnover can adversely affect the quality of public services when the bureaucracy is not shielded from the political process.

Neighbourhood type (based on land use mix) is used to partition data and investigate how pre-existing land use, treatment with a park-and-ride (PAR) versus walk-and-ride (WAR) station and overlay zoning interrelate. Hedonic models estimate capitalisation effects of LRT-related accessibility and overlay zoning on single-family houses and condos in different neighbourhoods for the system in metropolitan Phoenix, Arizona. Impacts differ by housing and neighbourhood type. Amenity-dominated mixed-use neighbourhoods\textemdash predominantly WAR communities\textemdash experience premiums of 6 per cent for single-family houses and over 20 per cent for condos, the latter boosted an additional 37 per cent by overlay zoning. Residential neighbourhoods\textemdash predominantly PAR communities\textemdash experience no capitalisation benefits for single-family houses and a discount for condos. The results suggest that land use mix is an important variable to select comparable neighbourhoods.},

  abstract = {The spatial mismatch hypothesis states that a lack of connection to job opportunities may affect an individual's prospects in the labour market, especially for lowskilled workers. This phenomenon is especially observed in large urban areas, in which lowskilled minorities tend to live far away from jobs and face geographical barriers to finding and keeping jobs. This paper aims to investigate whether this negative relationship between spatial mismatch and labour market outcomes is valid in Brazil after controlling for individual characteristics. Our conclusions indicate that there is no clear relation between different measures of accessibility to jobs and the probability of being unemployed. However, for wages there is a clear correlation, which is stronger in larger metropolitan areas in the country. Given the exploratory nature of this work, our results still rely on strong identification hypotheses to avoid potential bias related to simultaneous location decisions of workers and firms within the city. Even if these conditions do not hold, the results are still meaningful as they provide a better understanding of the conditional distribution of wages and the unemployment rate in the biggest metropolitan areas of Brazil.},

  abstract = {"This book emerges from a 55-year career in urban planning, and is illustrated by the author's real-world experience. Without understanding how markets work, urban planners are likely to design infrastructure and regulations that will adversely impact the functioning of cities. By contrast, urban economists review decisions and outcomes after the fact, often publishing their conclusions in specialized journals that fail to influence decision making. This book is a call for qualitative urban planners and quantitative urban economists to come together. Specifically, the book calls for urban economists to take a larger role in the process of operational urban planning. For example, land prices decrease the further away one gets from a city center. When land prices are high, households and firms consume less land; that is, they live in smaller homes and work in smaller offices. Population density then increases because the city is still a desirable place to be, and you can fit more people in smaller spaces. While urban planning often tries to limit densities, it is almost impossible to do so when the price of land is high. Without understanding the factors that lead to high prices, urban planners cannot effectively plan cities, and rents skyrocket and commutes take longer. Cities generate a large amount of data, often recorded in urban departments, but remain unused; urban economists can make use of this new data and provide answers to critical questions in urban economic development. The book does not introduce new concepts of urban economics but uses existing theories to try to improve the practice of urban planning. It looks at such topics as infrastructure, housing affordability, transportation, labor markets, regulation, mobility, and pollution"--},

Using a theoretical framework that relates the elasticity of demand in informal and formal sectors of the housing market, the paper argues that inappropriate regulations raise prices in the formal market and generate more untitled housing. Of the four types of urban regulations examined, zoning seems to have the largest impact on informal settlements. Controlling for the time of enactment of the regulation reinforces these conclusions. The findings are consistent with a market with double standards and refute the notion that formal and informal markets are completely independent. On a policy level, the results suggest that land use or building regulations should not be abolished but instead revised to address the issue of informality appropriately.},

When the effects of treatment cross over borders, classical difference-in-differences estimation produces biased estimates for the average treatment effect. In this paper, I introduce a potential outcomes framework to model spillover effects and decompose the estimate's bias in two parts: (1) the control group no longer identifies the counterfactual trend because their outcomes are affected by treatment and (2) changes in treated units' outcomes reflect the effect of their own treatment status and the effect from the treatment status of "close" units. I propose estimation strategies that can remove both sources of bias and semi-parametrically estimate the spillover effects themselves including in settings with staggered treatment timing. To highlight the importance of spillover effects, I revisit analyses of three place-based interventions.},

We discuss alternative, typically stronger, assumptions that alleviate these challenges. We also provide a variety of treatment effect decomposition results, highlighting that parameters associated with popular two-way fixed-effect specifications can be hard to interpret, even when there are only two time periods. We introduce alternative estimation strategies that do not suffer from these drawbacks. Our results also cover cases where (i) there is no available untreated comparison group and (ii) there are multiple periods and variation in treatment timing, which are both common in empirical work.},

We do not determine exogenously central business centers (CBD) or sub-centers (SBD), but estimate the wage premium for each cell and for two layers of surrounding cells. Based on the wage premium estimated in these three layers, we were able to estimate the attenuation effect. This way of estimating the wage premium and its attenuation in space is novel to the literature. We estimate POLS and Fixed Effects specifications to illustrate how the sorting of workers and firms is powerful in biasing the estimated coefficients. Since sorting might be present even after the introduction of fixed effects of worker, firm, cell, sector-cell and matches firm-worker-cell, we run a 2SLS-IV model. We instrumentalize employment in the cells by the additional constructed area for business and housing purposes, lagged by 7 years. Even after controlling for those time-constant effects, our instrumental variable estimation provides evidence of an intra-urban wage premium and its non-isotropic agglomeration effects. The estimated premium is larger by multiples of the POLS or Fixed Effects estimations. The magnitude of the effects is economically relevant: the introduction of 100,000 additional workers in the inner cell produces a 1.78\% increase in wages in that cell. The effects on the surrounding cells are negative and much larger than in other forms of estimation that do not correct for endogeneity. The heterogeneity analysis revealed that educated workers benefit the most from the increased interaction possibilities given by concentration and they are less affected when located in the surrounding cells.},

However, the line connects to areas with significantly higher shares of high-wage workers and industries. While creating accessibility to higher-skilled jobs may result in greater economic impacts, it may conflict with goals of increasing employment opportunities for transit dependent, lower-wage workers.},

The paper combines different analytical frameworks (engineering, economics, impacts), systematic review techniques, and advanced mappings. Framing economic efficiency studies into a transport planning perspective permits to move from efficiency to effectiveness issues. In addition, including impacts offers a critical discussion of the existing empirical studies, relating them to the main methodological approaches used. This analysis can be useful for those interested in developing new techniques for the evaluation of this sector. The critical analysis developed in this paper provides a catalog of inputs, outputs, external factors, possible impacts to account for, data, and approaches, which allows us to identify areas in which new methodological developments, new approaches, are needed to address the relevant societal challenges of the rail transport sector.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this work is to review urban transportation likely to be offered in the future. Trip-making behaviour has already changed considerably as lifestyles change and they will continue to change in the future. This work reflects and places emphasis on profound thinking about the possibilities, rather than predicting them. Thoughts about possibilities for the future draw upon imagination, perceived and justified feasibility, and lessons gained from the past. This work attempts to capture the possibilities, logistics and travel modes of future urban transportation. A visionary, feasibility-related approach grounded in a realist perspective is proposed, only conceptually, to explore plausible visions for the future. In addition, this work shows the inefficiency of using private cars (PCs) and argues that in the development of autonomous and electric vehicles, PCs cannot provide a solution competitive with the potential that urban transportation systems have for the future. Hence, the solutions for the future must be based on public transport (PT) modes of travel, regardless of whether they are metro, bus, light rail, tram, ridesharing services, an ordinary taxi, personal rapid transit, or any other PT-based future mode. The key principal of operation for the mobility of a smart city will be the ability to optimize the connectivity of movement in order to approach a seamless move, while endowing the phrase door-to-door travel with new meaning. Finally, it would be remiss not to mention the unforeseeable implications of the Covid-19 pandemic for future mobility, more controllable by automation of non-privately owned vehicle, and with the prospect of people demonstrating a greater inclination towards changing their habits, behaviour, and thinking paradigms.},

  abstract = {Public transport improvements may increase economic productivity if they enable the growth and densification of cities, downtowns, or industrial clusters and thereby increase external agglomeration economies. It has been argued that the potential agglomeration benefits are large; if so, understanding them better would be useful in making funding decisions about public transport improvements. We reviewed theoretical and empirical literature on agglomeration as well as a small number of articles on transportation's role in agglomeration. The theoretical literature is useful in understanding possible avenues by which transportation improvements might affect agglomeration, although there is little discussion of public transport specifically. Relevant empirical studies tend to focus on metropolitan regions and use a generalized measure of transportation cost. But public transport impacts on agglomeration are likely to be different from road investment impacts. We identified several ways of conducting research building on this literature that would help evaluate the agglomeration impacts of public transport proposals: tracing the links between transport, agglomeration, and productivity; better motivating research using theories of agglomeration mechanisms; taking scale and redistribution into account; exploring the functional form of agglomeration economies; accounting for endogeneity in model structure; and considering development context.}

The results show that residents' willingness to pay for urban hukou in Jinan City was approximately 90,000\textendash 126,000 yuan in 2017. We also find great heterogeneity in different housing submarkets; the value of hukou is much higher in immigrant-dominated housing markets and top primary school districts.

We perform falsification tests by assuming a false policy introduction date and placebo tests based on rental data.

We use the universe of legal dumping of sanitation waste from May 2009 to May 2018 to show that legal dumping increased substantially following privatization\textemdash on average an increase of 74\%, or an increase of about 1640 trips to treatment centers each month. This is due to increased productivity of all trucks, not just those associated with the company managing the privatized treatment centers. Household-level survey data shows that downstream prices of legal sanitary dumping decreased by 5\% following privatization, and DHS data shows that diarrhea rates among children under five decreased in Dakar relative to secondary cities in Senegal following privatization with no similar effect on respiratory illness as a placebo.},

This allows us to give a precise characterisation of some of the main theoretical underpinnings of urban agglomeration economies, to discuss modelling issues that arise when working with these tools, and to compare different sources of agglomeration economies in terms of the aggregate urban outcomes they produce as well as in terms of their normative implications.},

The municipality stood out for ecotourism, one of the branches of this activity, which uses the natural and cultural heritage in a sustainable way, for the purpose of its conservation. The input-output matrix allows the identification of the impacts of each activity in relation to the entire economy. It was observed that the representativeness of the touristic activity for the municipality's economy is small, although through IOM, it can be inferred that with investments it could generate positive results for the municipality. Relevant is the Municipal Tourism Plan for the period from 2017 to 2027, however, without forecasting monetary values for investment in the activity for the development of local potential. Through IOM, it was observed that through a shock in specific sectors, it will result in impacts on job creation, remuneration and added value, both direct, indirect and induced.},

The model considers two aspects of land use: land as a measure of production cost and land as a physical entity that can be used in a variety of ways. To analyze the economic effects of climate change, we integrated the CGE model and an econometric model. The results based on this model, which captures how land allocation responds to changes in temperature and precipitation, are introduced as elasticities in the CGE model to offset the demand curve for land among 13 different land uses in 27 regions of Brazil. The simulations are based on climate data from a benchmark period (1975\textendash 2005) and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change climate projection scenarios for the periods 2010\textendash 2039, 2040\textendash 2069, and 2070\textendash 2099.

The second paper (Mooya and Cloete) uses the tools of the New Institutional Economics to analyze the argument in Hernando DeSoto's path-breaking book, The Mystery of Capital, that full legal tide is the key to turning 'dead capital' in the form of informal property held by many low-income families into an economic asset and to detonating broad-based economic growth. The paper concludes that intermediate forms of tenure can have the virtues of full legal tide if properly constructed, and then examines the case of Namibia in this context. The third paper (Fernandes) documents and assesses the recent efforts of the Brazilian federal Ministry of Cities to develop a comprehensive approach for regularizing title throughout that country. In the fourth paper, Abramo gives a structural and theoretical over-view of informal settlement in Brazil. The fifth paper (Rakodi) looks at traditional land delivery systems in five medium-sized Sub-Saharan African cities, and concludes that policies and programs can build on their strengths.},

For the case of the polycentric Barcelona, the aims of this study are to test: whether its employment is moving from polycentricity to scatteration; and, whether its employment location model is increasingly random and unstructured. The results show that, in spite of the decentralisation and deconcentration processes, employment concentrated in centres still represents a significant percentage of total employment and new sub-centres have emerged in the periphery. What is more, the results also show an increasing influence of employment sub-centres on employment location and density conditions. As a result, polycentricity has been reinforced.},

In order to make proper causal inference, we rely on historical instruments and control for all other transportation modes that could be complement or substitute to the RER. Our results show that proximity to an RER station increases employment and population density and, in particular, employment and population growth. The latter effects are higher in municipalities located near RER stations and close to employment (sub)centers. They are also found to be particularly strong for jobs in the service sector, for factory workers, and for highly educated population. We find no impact of the RER expansion on employment growth during the first part of the period, while the effect on population growth appears earlier but declines over time.},

The results analyzed refer to: a) type I production multipliers; b) Rasmussen-Hirschman backward and forward linkages; and c) Pure backward and forward linkages. Based on statistical methods (correlation indexes), the results show that the estimated matrices are similar to the ones released by IBGE. As so, this methodology can be used to estimate Brazilian national input-output matrices for the time periods where there are only preliminary data, and the economic structural analysis made with the estimated matrices are valid for the years analyzed.},

Chapter 4 deals with how the input-output data is overall processed and disseminated by the statistical agencies, and specifically by the Brazilian statistical office (IBGE), and how this information can be analyzed to allow the system to work with the original Leontief model. Chapter 5 deals with how the original Leontief model, developed for a national economy can be extended to the analysis of regional economies, either for a single region or for several interconnected regions. Chapter 6 presents the basic methods of analysis used with input-output models. Chapter 7 deals with the use of input-output in modeling environmental issues. The discussion of how input-output matrices can be obtained by using census and non-census methods is made in Chapter 8. Finally, Chapter 9 aims to present the various possible applications of input-output analysis, while at the same time, outlining the possible future paths in terms of using this powerful tool of analysis.},

The S\~ao Paulo subway network reaches 74.2 kilometers of length and is involved in around 20\% of the commuting trips by public transportation, enhancing mobility and productivity of workers. This paper uses an integrated framework to assess the wider economic impacts of the existing underground metro infrastructure. We consider links between mobility, accessibility and labor productivity in the context of a detailed metropolitan system embedded in the national economy. Simulation results from a spatial computable general equilibrium model integrated to a transportation model suggest positive economic impacts that go beyond the city limits. While 32\% of the impacts accrue to the city of S\~ao Paulo, the remaining 68\% benefit other municipalities in the metropolitan area (11\%), in the State of S\~ao Paulo (12.0\%) and in the rest of the country (45\%). The estimated impact on annual Brazilian GDP is equivalent to approximately 65\% of the construction cost of the whole network.},

In this paper, we first explore such phenomenon from the perspective of the distance of the residence to the geographic concentration of jobs, and locational disadvantages of the urban form itself. Such unequal conditions in the labor market present a great challenge for the spatial sustainability of the multiple equilibria achieved simultaneously at the labor and the housing markets. We estimate the main aspects that influence wage differentials among individuals, focusing on the role of accessibility on labor market outcomes. We suggest the inclusion of geographical characteristics as instruments to deal with endogeneity problems that arise in the estimation of urban price models. Our strategy is based on the inclusion of a specific geographic/historic variable as instrument, namely the river shore access to the first school built by the Jesuits in S\~ao Paulo, the city's founding location. Geography acted as a determinant of the location of the transportation infrastructure in the region, so that the road and rail networks in the city present a strong spatial correlation with pre-urban ``waterways''. Nowadays, the vast majority of rivers and creeks are covered with asphalt and cement, and economic agents are practically unaware of their existence.},

In contrast, we employ an agent-based modeling (ABM) approach that seeks to replicate the individual household and firm behaviors that lead to equilibrium or nonequilibrium outcomes. The F \^ O model has little to say about what happens outside of equilibrium, while the ABM approach is preoccupied with this question and is particularly well suited to address questions of path dependency and bounded rationality that lie well beyond the scope of the F \^ O original. We demonstrate that the urban outcomes that emerge depend critically upon the bidding behavior of agents and the institutional context within which their decisions are made.},

We test two different specifications, one with the original independent variables, and another with factors to correct for multicollinearity. In addition to the traditional monocentric model, we include an accessibility vector for a duocentric city. A criterion to select the appropriate environmental variables based on residual spatial interpolation is introduced. We conclude that proximity to train stations, green areas and strict residential zones raise rents, while criminality reduces them.},

  abstract = {Identifying and measuring the land value uplift (LVU) impacts of rapid transit are important for a number of reasons. However, despite the general notion that rapid transit does confer positive LVU benefits, our comprehensive and critical review of more than 130 analyses across 60 studies completed in North America over the past 40 years finds significant heterogeneity in research outcomes, leaving many significant questions unanswered. Beyond high-level differences in study inputs, we argue that a fundamental source of variability is a lack of empirical specificity from the use of proximity as the dominant way in which LVU benefits are captured. This use of a proxy leads to the potential for omitted variables and unobserved relationships, and exposes previous work to the potential for misvalued results. To overcome this issue, we outline recommendations for future research, namely a recognition of relative accessibility and the possibility of LVU impacts from transit-oriented development. Incorporating measures related to these factors into LVU models can reveal their implicit prices, resulting in research that is more theoretically inclusive, empirically comprehensive, comparable, and able to provide important information to inform policy analysis and prescription.},

The cumulative economic freedom index show us how open and business friendly a country is. The sub-indices show us openness across different sector of the economy, for example, the financial sector or the trade sector etc. Traditional neo-classical economic theories have explained economic growth looking at the supply of labor, capital and state of technology, with little attention being paid to institutional factors. The study presents evidence based on two panel data-sets. The first set consists of 186 countries over the period 2013, 2014 and 2015 that show institutional factors play a crucial role in economic growth. A second data-set with data for 57 countries for the period 2004\textendash 2014 also show a positive impact on the index on the growth rate of per capita GDP.},

Esta monografia aborda o car\'ater legislativo, geom\'etrico e econ\^omico de Belo Horizonte e de centros urbanos no Brasil e no mundo e estabelece uma conex\~ao emp\'irica entre a estrutura espacial urbana e o desenvolvimento econ\^omico. Consistente com as economias de aglomera\c{c}\~ao, a varia\c{c}\~ao da densidade urbana e os n\'iveis de capital humano se mostraram eficazes em explicar as varia\c{c}\~oes na produtividade. Similar ao efeito evidenciado na literatura internacional, a produtividade aumenta em 9,13\% com a dobra da densidade urbana no n\'ivel metropolitano. J\'a a n\'ivel municipal, a produtividade aumenta em 22,78\% sobre o mesmo efeito. No entanto, o estudo demonstra que a medida de densidade utilizada n\~ao leva em conta a estrutura espacial dos centros urbanos. O efeito da densidade estrutural, uma abordagem que leva em conta as dist\^ancias entre as regi\~oes populosas dos centros urbanos, \'e em m\'edia 15\% superior para o n\'ivel metropolitano e 5\% superior no n\'ivel municipal. Al\'em disso, a integra\c{c}\~ao do modelo de produtividade a modelos de estrutura espacial demonstra que a produtividade \'e superior para uma estrutura monoc\^entrica por elevar a densidade e diminuir as dist\^ancias. O estudo evidencia que se Belo Horizonte fosse uma cidade monoc\^entrica forte, a produtividade da popula\c{c}\~ao seria 30\% superior. Contudo, a parametriza\c{c}\~ao do modelo econ\^omico a modelos urbanos reais, um subproduto desta pesquisa, representa um salto tecnol\'ogico no que tange a avalia\c{c}\~ao e simula\c{c}\~ao de pol\'iticas urbanas, an\'alise de investimentos e choques de mercado bem como viabilidade de empreendimentos do setor privado.},

An international visitors' expenditure survey and input\textendash output models were used to disaggregate tourism economic data from the economy. A series of approaches was then employed to construct inter-industry linkage measures. The results reveal a rising trend in tourism's linkages with the country's economy from 2003 to 2008, indicating an increase in the tourism sector's dependency on the rest of the economy. The key sectors are food and beverages, manufacturing, wholesale and retail trade, agriculture and livestock, and tourism \textendash{} these sectors dominated the economy during 2003\textendash 2008.

Four steps are taken: (1) the setting of system boundaries according to the combined IO and TSA database; (2) economic benefit estimation for tourism income, sectoral multipliers and inter-sector linkages; (3) environmental pollution estimation of direct and indirect CO2 emissions; and (4) a policy analysis to balance the economic benefit and CO2 emissions (in terms of reducing the CO2 emissions intensity) in tourism-related sectors. In the case of Beijing, some interesting insights can be obtained. Beijing's tourism sectors experienced a fast economic growth and a clear decrease in CO2 emissions during 2007\textendash 2012, with the former having a greater absolute change rate (particularly for the shopping and sightseeing sectors). In all tourism sectors (except for transportation), the indirect CO2 emissions were over three times greater than the direct CO2 emissions. Transportation was a leading contributor to both the economic benefit (representing 91.65\% of tourism income in 2012) and to environmental pollution (representing 38.75\% of tourism-related CO2 emissions). The detailed findings regarding the industrial and energy structures offer insightful policies for a high-benefit and low-emissions development of tourism.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Cities worldwide are pursuing policies to reduce car use and prioritise public transit (PT) as a means to tackle congestion, air pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions. The increase of PT ridership is constrained by many aspects; among them, travel time and the built environment are considered the most critical factors in the choice of travel mode. We propose a data fusion framework including real-time traffic data, transit data, and travel demand estimated using Twitter data to compare the travel time by car and PT in four cities (S\~ao Paulo, Brazil; Stockholm, Sweden; Sydney, Australia; and Amsterdam, the Netherlands) at high spatial and temporal resolutions. We use real-world data to make realistic estimates of travel time by car and by PT and compare their performance by time of day and by travel distance across cities. Our results suggest that using PT takes on average 1.4\textendash 2.6 times longer than driving a car. The share of area where travel time~favours PT over car use is very small: 0.62\% (0.65\%), 0.44\% (0.48\%), 1.10\% (1.22\%) and 1.16\% (1.19\%) for the daily average (and during peak hours) for S\~ao Paulo, Sydney, Stockholm, and Amsterdam, respectively. The travel time disparity, as quantified by the travel time ratio                                                   \$\$R\$\$                                        R                                                                  (PT travel time divided by the car travel time), varies widely during an average weekday, by location and time of day. A systematic comparison between these two modes shows that the average travel time disparity is surprisingly similar across cities:                                                   \$\$R {$<$} 1\$\$                                        R                     {$<$}                     1                                                                  for travel distances less than 3 km, then increases rapidly but quickly stabilises at around 2. This study contributes to providing a more realistic performance evaluation that helps future studies further explore what city characteristics as well as urban and transport policies make public transport more attractive, and to create a more sustainable future for cities.},

  abstract = {Literature on growth accounting has generally introduced productivity to explain the growth of services. One of the most conventional statements in economics, with regard to the services sector suggests that, as a whole, this sector has a lower productivity level than the other productive sectors, and that its growth is always quite slow. Such a statement is based initially on the personal nature of many services, which makes it difficult to substitute the work for capital factor and the incorporation of technical progress. From this approach we can derive the relative lower productivity in some advanced economies (such as the European countries versus the United States and some particular emergent economies) as an explanation of the growth of the tertiary sector. In this working paper, we will look in greater depth at issues related to services productivity, from conceptual aspects regarding the definition and meaning of productivity, to methodological and measurement of services productivity. This paper is essentially a necessary state of the art of relationships between economic growth and productivity within services sector, reviewing not only the conventional literature but also those new waves of thinking.},

Eighteen of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) indicators require having estimates of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), making subnational GDP estimates crucial for local SDG monitoring. However, many countries do not produce official subnational GDP estimates. Using Paraguay as an example, we show how nightlights imagery from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite's Day-Night Band (VIIRS-DNB) and data from neighboring countries can be used to produce subnational GDP estimates. We first estimate the relationship between VIIRS and economic activity in South American countries at the first subnational administrative level, employing various econometric models. Results suggest that nightlights are strongly predictive of subnational GDP variation in South American countries with available data. We assess various models' goodness-of-fit using both cross-validation against other countries' subnational GDP data and comparing predictions against an input\textendash output accounting of Paraguay's subnational GDP. Finally, we use the preferred model to produce a time series of department-level GDP in Paraguay.},

Many researches and policies were aimed at discouraging the use of cars. The approach taken here is not to force conversion of present automobiles drivers into collective transport users, but to make sure new commuters will predominately choose more sustainable modes of transport in the future. The key aspect is the appropriate location of new dense residential developments. Monocentric ``compactness'' does not necessarily result in a higher energy efficient city. Considering that further densification of Bergen Sentrum is not a feasible political/physical option, a light rail networks could lead, accordingly to the least commuting principle, to a denser city along the Bybanen route. As a strong sustainable symbol and a serious financial commitment, the Bybanen has the potential transform expectations and attitudes. Ultimately the Bybanen is a proficient strategy that will reshape the city; an opportunity to reduce GHG emissions and increase the societal welfare through (green) mobility.},

This study provides an analysis of the spatial distributions of job accessibility, housing rents, and poverty in a large African city. In Nairobi, Kenya, workers and jobs are not well connected: On average, residents can access fewer than 10 percent of existing jobs by foot within an hour. Even using a minibus, they can reach only about a quarter of jobs. This study further demonstrates that poorer households and residents living in informal settlements are even more limited. Living closer to job opportunities is costly in Nairobi. Not only are housing quality and living conditions frequently better in such areas, but the high value placed on job accessibility also makes these areas more expensive. This severely affects the residential location choices of low-income households.},

A number of different measures of accessibility, defined as the potential to reach spatially dispersed opportunities, have been proposed in the literature, and used to address various substantive planning and policy questions. Our objective in this paper is to conduct a review of various commonly used measures of accessibility, with a particular view to clarifying their normative (i.e. prescriptive), as well as positive (i.e. descriptive) aspects. This is a distinction that has seldom been made in the literature and that helps to better understand the meaning of alternative ways to implement the concept of accessibility. Our discussion of the positive and normative aspects of accessibility measurements is illustrated using the city of Montreal, Canada, as a case study. The example highlights the differences in the measured levels of accessibility depending on implementation. Comparison of the two by means of a relative indicator of accessibility helps to identify the gap between desired (as normative defined) and actual (as revealed) accessibility levels.},

Thus, the elaboration of indicators that help designing public policies aimed at this set of activities is essential for the development strategies of these regions. In this sense, this paper makes a first contribution by developing a methodology capable of introducing a specific sector for tourism in input-output matrices (IOM). Using an MIP and tourism satellite accounts for the economy of Cear\'a, a new MIP is built using the proposed methodology. An additional contribution of this paper is the pull index, capable of synthesizing the indices of forward and backward links, as well as their dispersions in a single result. The results obtained indicate that tourism has the fifth highest traction index, being the seventh sector in terms of employment and income multipliers.},

The use of identical methodologies and similar data sets allows for the creation of the first benchmark to compare accessibility across urban areas in Africa through different metrics and visuals. The study shows how the spatial pattern of land use and transport systems perform in connecting people to employment opportunities in these various settings. This first comparable benchmark is achieved by overcoming two significant data hurdles that are common in many developing country cities and in Africa in particular: (i) the scarcity of information on the distribution of employment and (ii) the lack of information on transit routes and travel times. These data gaps are filled through a novel methodology to estimate the distribution of employment in urban areas (Employment Opportunity Areas) as well as a comprehensive mapping of informal transit networks. The analysis developed here can be replicated in different cities in the future. The computation of these baseline accessibility studies also opens up the possibility to assess the impacts of future transport investments and/or land use changes, through the use of counterfactual scenarios, which could assist decision makers in these cities. Finally, this analysis can serve as a demonstration that the computation of accessibility metrics is achievable, including in data scarce environments, and should be considered as a progress indicator for Sustainable Development Goal 11.2, which focuses on safe and affordable transport for all, including public transport.},

We analyzed data on the changing patterns of consumption of transportation goods and services by Brazilian families over the last 20 years. We also analyzed how urban transportation costs, the demand for public transport, and the country's vehicle fleet have evolved in that period. All the analyses conducted pointed to a gradual and persistent trend of households moving away from public transportation towards individual modes of transport, mainly among the middle and lower classes in medium and small cities. These changing patterns caused a continuous deterioration of mobility conditions in Brazilian cities, significantly increasing the time people tend to spend in traffic. Furthermore, we demonstrate how people are unequally affected by poor mobility conditions according to their socioeconomic status, gender, and color. Finally, we show how the economic and public health crisis generated by the Covid-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on urban mobility patterns, causing a sharp decline in the numbers of daily public transport passengers across the country. Those findings indicate that the Covid-19 pandemic will likely deepen the vicious cycle of passenger loss and increasing public transport fares, thus accelerating the historical trend of modal shifts from public transportation to individual modes of transport in Brazilian cities. At the end of the study we point to a few urban and transport policies that could help mitigate this trend.},

  abstract = {Este estudo apresenta um diagn\'ostico de como o uso do transporte individual motorizado e do transporte coletivo tem evolu\'ido desde o in\'icio dos anos 2000 nas cidades brasileiras. N\'os analisamos dados sobre mudan\c{c}as no padr\~ao de consumo de bens e servi\c{c}os de transporte, o aumento de renda das fam\'ilias, al\'em da evolu\c{c}\~ao dos custos de transporte urbano, da demanda por transporte p\'ublico e da frota de ve\'iculos no pa\'is nos \'ultimos vinte anos. Em todas as dimens\~oes analisadas, os dados apresentam uma trajet\'oria gradual e persistente de substitui\c{c}\~ao do consumo de transporte coletivo pelo individual motorizado, principalmente entre as classes m\'edias e baixas, e nas cidades de m\'edio e pequeno porte. O estudo aponta ainda como essas mudan\c{c}as t\^em se refl etido na cont\'inua deteriora\c{c}\~ao das condi\c{c}\~oes de mobilidade e no consequente aumento no tempo que as pessoas passam no tr\^ansito, afetando de maneira desigual a popula\c{c}\~ao, de acordo com n\'ivel socioecon\^omico, g\^enero e cor. Por fi m, n\'os mostramos como a crise econ\^omica e de sa\'ude p\'ublica gerada pela pandemia da Covid-19 teve um profundo impacto na redu\c{c}\~ao dos n\'iveis de mobilidade urbana e, em particular, na intensifi ca\c{c}\~ao da queda do n\'umero de passageiros do transporte p\'ublico ao longo de 2020. Com isso, a crise do novo coronav\'irus deve aprofundar o ciclo vicioso de perda de passageiros e eleva\c{c}\~ao de tarifas no transporte p\'ublico e acentuar a tend\^encia hist\'orica de substitui\c{c}\~ao do transporte coletivo pelo individual nas cidades brasileiras.

From last few years, there has been a great surge in international tourism, culminates to 7\% share of World's total exports in 2016. To this end, the study attempts to examine the relationship between inbound tourism, financial development and economic growth by using the panel data over the period 1995\textendash 2015 for five BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) countries. The results of panel ARDL cointegration test indicate that tourism, financial development and economic growth are cointegrated in the long run. Further, the Granger causality analysis demonstrates that the causality between inbound tourism and economic growth is bi-directional, thus validates the `feedback-hypothesis' in BRICS countries. The study suggests that BRICS countries should promote favorable tourism policies to push up the economic growth and in turn economic growth will positively contribute to international tourism.},

Our discussion highlights the different ways that the DiD literature has advanced beyond the canonical model, and helps to clarify when each of the papers will be relevant for empirical work. We conclude by discussing some promising areas for future research.},

The main objective is to develop an explanation for inconsistent results presented in this literature over the past several decades. Results from these studies vary based on whether travel time or travel distance is used as a measure of accessibility. When researchers measure access to highways and rail transit in terms of travel time, study results usually indicate the expected inverse relationship between access to transportation facilities and property values. When studies use travel distance as a measure of access to transportation facilities, results tend to show mixed property value effects. The delineation of study areas also appears to influence the direction of results. This article offers a new interpretation of the transportation facility-property value literature that improves our ability to measure this relationship and to anticipate land-market responses to transportation facilities.},

METHODS: By using data from the Health section of 2008's Pesquisa Nacional por Amostra de Domic\'ilio (Brazil's National Household Sample Survey), we estimated how often employed people walk or cycle to work, disaggregating our results by sex, age range, education level, household monthly income per capita, urban or rural address, metropolitan regions, and macro-regions in Brazil. Furthermore, we estimated the distribution of this same frequency according to quintiles of household monthly income per capita in each metropolitan region of the country. RESULTS: A third of the employed men and women walk or cycle from home to work in Brazil. For both sexes, this share decreases as income and education levels rise, and it is higher among younger individuals, especially among those living in rural areas and in the Northeast region of the country. Depending on the metropolitan region, the practice of active transportation is two to five times more frequent among low-income individuals than among high-income individuals. CONCLUSIONS: Walking or cycling to work in Brazil is most frequent among low-income individuals and the ones living in less economically developed areas. Active transportation evaluation in Brazil provides important information for public health and urban mobility policy-making},

We estimate both the trade in value-added (TiVA) and the CO2 content embedded in interregional and foreign exports, mapping the relative intensity of CO2 emission levels on value chains. For that, we applied an inter-regional input-output model to determine the interplay between the CO2 emission embedded in goods of resource-based industries and their linkages with other economic industries, revealing a map of CO2 emissions on trade in value-added trade from a subnational dimension. The main result reveals an interregional dependence, indicating a higher level of embedded CO2 on value-added in each regional economy for resource-based industries, usually intense in CO2 emissions. This finding has considerable implications for the sustainable development goals of these subnational areas, as the spatial concentration of production leads to an unbalanced regional capacity for promoting reductions in CO2 emissions along with value chains.},

Therefore, a model of hedonic prices with correction for different types of spatial dependence was considered and a rich database provided by the City Hall was used, which includes information about sold properties and urban amenities. The evidence indicates that ``ocean view'' and proximity to the river are the most valued amenities in the city, while the value of real estate tends to be negatively affected by proximity to ZEIS, subways and violent places.},

  abstract = {REVISED MARCH 2019 This paper studies the effects of Los Angeles Metro Rail on the spatial distribution of people and prices. Using a panel of bilateral commuting flows, I estimate a quantitative spatial general equilibrium model to quantify the welfare benefits of urban rail transit and distinguish the benefits of reduced commuting frictions from other channels. The subway causes a 7\%-13\% increase in commuting between pairs of connected tracts; I select plausible control pairs using proposed subway and historical streetcar lines to identify this effect. The structural parameters of the model are also estimated and are identified using a novel strategy that interacts tract-specific labor demand shocks with the spatial configuration of the city. These parameters indicate people are relatively unresponsive to changes in local prices and characteristics, implying that the commuting response corresponds to a large utility gain. The welfare benefits by 2000 are significant: LA Metro Rail increases aggregate welfare by \$246 million annually. However, these benefits are only about one-third of annualized costs. While benefits did not outweigh costs by 2000, I employ more recent data to show that there are dynamic effects: Commuting continues to increase between connected locations.},

This phenomenon, known as the urban wage premium, supports the notion that urbanization and the growth of cities contribute positively to human well-being. However, it remains unclear how the distribution of wages changes as cities grow. Here we segment the populations of U.S. cities into wage deciles and determine the scaling coefficient of each decile's aggregate wages versus city size. We find that, while total wages of all deciles grow superlinearly with city size, the effect is uneven, with total wages of the highest wage earners growing faster than all other deciles. We show that this corresponds with the predominance of high-wage jobs in larger cities. Thus, the effects of urbanization are mixed -- it is associated with higher average wages but with increasing inequality, thus inhibiting prospects for long-term sustainability.},

Nesse contexto, o Nordeste do Brasil possui grandes vantagens comparativas, pois \'e uma regi\~ao com dota\c{c}\~ao de fatores prop\'icios ao aproveitamento econ\^omico dessas atividades, como, por exemplo, o litoral extenso formado por belas praias. Assim, neste estudo foram analisadas as participa\c{c}\~oes das atividades tur\'isticas na economia do Nordeste e suas rela\c{c}\~oes intersetoriais, a partir de uma matriz insumo-produto inter-regional, referente ao ano de 2009, de forma in\'edita. Tamb\'em foram levantadas informa\c{c}\~oes referentes \`as caracter\'isticas da m\~ao de obra empregada no setor de turismo, com \^enfase no estudo do n\'ivel de informalidade observada nas atividades tur\'isticas. Por fim, foram investigados os impactos do aumento da demanda do turismo no Nordeste sobre a desigualdade de renda na regi\~ao e no Brasil. Os resultados encontrados mostram uma participa\c{c}\~ao do setor de turismo equivalente a 2,77\% do PIB do Nordeste, enquanto que no Brasil essa participa\c{c}\~ao foi de 2,27\%. Assim, o setor de turismo foi mais importante para a economia nordestina, se comparado \`as demais regi\~oes do pa\'is. Verificou-se, tamb\'em, que o Nordeste tem um peso maior no setor de turismo do pa\'is, do que sua participa\c{c}\~ao m\'edia na economia brasileira, em termos de emprego e renda. De fato, h\'a evid\^encias de uma especializa\c{c}\~ao da economia nordestina no setor de turismo no pa\'is. Quanto ao n\'ivel de informalidade no turismo, percebeu-se um percentual de m\~ao de obra informal no setor do turismo acima da m\'edia observada para o setor na economia brasileira e, al\'em disso, acima da pr\'opria m\'edia de informalidade observada na economia Nordestina, que \'e caracterizada como a regi\~ao mais informal do pa\'is. Na \'ultima parte deste estudo foi verificado um efeito positivo do setor de turismo sobre a redu\c{c}\~ao da desigualdade de renda na regi\~ao Nordeste e no Brasil.},

  abstract = {Cumulative accessibility measures allow one to estimate the number of opportunities that can be reached within a given travel time threshold. They have become the most commonly used metric in transport research and planning because of how simple it makes to calculate and communicate accessibility results. However, cumulative opportunity measures require an ad-hoc choice of a single travel time threshold, which can importantly influence the conclusions of transport project evaluations and equity analyses. In this paper, we introduce the time interval cumulative accessibility measure, a new accessibility metric that mitigates the impacts of arbitrary choices of trip duration on cumulative accessibility analyses while keeping its computation and communicability advantages. The proposed indicator estimates the average or the median number of opportunities that can be reached considering multiple minute-by-minute travel time cutoffs within a given travel time interval. We demonstrate the new metric in a case study assessing how a planned subway expansion will likely impact employment accessibility in Fortaleza, Brazil. Using sensitivity analyses with Monte Carlo simulations, we demonstrate that the selection of travel time thresholds can substantially bias the results of accessibility levels and that such biases are not evenly distributed in space, having important implications for equity analyses. We also show that the proposed time interval cumulative opportunity metric makes the results of accessibility estimates and inequality analyses significantly less sensitive to ad-hoc methodological choices while yielding results that are very similar to those found with traditional threshold-based cumulative measures. Future accessibility-oriented transport research and planning could greatly benefit from the way in which the proposed time interval cumulative opportunity measure provides more robust accessibility estimates without compromising the communicability of results.},

The framework measures the gap between the current situation in terms of accessibility and inclusiveness, and a counterfactual scenario of a fully accessible and inclusive society. Design/methodology/approach The method consists of three steps. First, the conceptual framework was developed based on a literature review and expert knowledge. Second, the magnitudes for each domain of the framework was estimated for the reference year 2017 using data from various sources. Third, several sensitivity analyses were run using different assumptions and scenarios. Findings It was estimated that moving to a fully accessible and inclusive society would create a value of \$337.7bn (with a range of \$252.8\textendash\$422.7bn) for Canadian society in the reference year of 2017. This is a sizeable proportion of gross domestic product (17.6\%, with a range of 13.1\textendash 22.0\%) and is likely a conservative estimate of the potential benefits. Originality/value Understanding the magnitude of the economic benefits of an accessible and inclusive society can be extremely useful for governments, disability advocates and industry leaders as it provides invaluable information on the benefits of efforts, such as legislation, policies, programs and practices, to improve accessibility and inclusion of persons with disabilities. Furthermore, the total economic benefits and the benefits per person with a disability can serve as inputs in economic evaluations and impact assessments.},

Dadas as indica\c{c}\~oes da literatura e as evid\^encias mostradas nessa disserta\c{c}\~ao, a estrat\'egia mais confi\'avel para a busca de um modelo parece ser utilizar as estimativas dos modelos, em conjunto com as estat\'isticas de Moran, para identificar presen\c{c}a de algum tipo de correla\c{c}\~ao espacial, e do teste LM da vari\'avel dependente, para indicar esse tipo de correla\c{c}\~ao especificamente. Observa-se que, de modo geral, n\~ao h\'a muita diferen\c{c}a em termos de esperan\c{c}a dos par\^ametros n\~ao espaciais, quando comparadas a estima\c{c}\~oes tradicionais com as que utilizam as t\'ecnicas espaciais. Com isso, a indica\c{c}\~ao que se pode fazer \'e que o uso das ferramentas de econometria espacial deve ser aplicado quando o interesse da an\'alise \'e justamente na estima\c{c}\~ao dos par\^ametros de correla\c{c}\~ao espacial. Comparando o uso da matriz de contig\"uidade no lugar da matriz de dist\^ancias, \'e poss\'ivel notar que a matriz de contig\"uidade n\~ao \'e, de forma geral, uma boa substitui\c{c}\~ao para a matriz de dist\^ancias. Ela capta parcialmente o efeito de rho e lambda, al\'em de captar erroneamente lambda, quando este inexiste.},

Standard Cost\textendash Benefit Analysis (CBA) is applied to quantify the user benefits of transport projects, but does not provide an answer as to who will obtain the benefits and who will lose out and excludes the calculation of Wider Economic Impacts (WEIs) which can sometimes be large and hardly negligible. This paper introduces thoughts and experiences obtained through the design and development of an integrated land use transport model for the assessment of the WEI of a transport infrastructure project. The development and application of such an integrated model for WEI analysis should help decision-makers understand not only the ``direct or immediate'' impact of transport infrastructure on mobility, but also those ``indirect or long-term'' impacts on the distribution patterns of economic activities, corresponding land use, and resulting urban structure.},

If substitution expenditure effects by residents are taken into account, interstate tourism contributed the greatest amount to gross state product and employment, followed by international visitors.

  abstract = {A quasi-experiment is an empirical interventional study used to estimate the causal impact of an intervention on target population without random assignment. Quasi-experimental research shares similarities with the traditional experimental design or randomized controlled trial, but it specifically lacks the element of random assignment to treatment or control. Instead, quasi-experimental designs typically allow the researcher to control the assignment to the treatment condition, but using some criterion other than random assignment (e.g., an eligibility cutoff mark).Quasi-experiments are subject to concerns regarding internal validity, because the treatment and control groups may not be comparable at baseline. In other words, it may not be possible to convincingly demonstrate a causal link between the treatment condition and observed outcomes. This is particularly true if there are confounding variables that cannot be controlled or accounted for.With random assignment, study participants have the same chance of being assigned to the intervention group or the comparison group. As a result, differences between groups on both observed and unobserved characteristics would be due to chance, rather than to a systematic factor related to treatment (e.g., illness severity). Randomization itself does not guarantee that groups will be equivalent at baseline. Any change in characteristics post-intervention is likely attributable to the intervention.},

A spatial-econometric hedonic housing price model is developed and estimated for the Seoul metropolitan area to measure the marginal value of improvements in sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen dioxide (NOx) concentrations. Diagnostic testing favored the spatial-lag model over the spatial error model. Results showed that SO2 pollution levels had a significant impact on housing prices while NOx pollution did not. The authors attribute this differential impact to the relatively higher levels of SO2 pollution when compared with pollution standards and the relative recency of the NOx pollution. Marginal WTP for a 4\% improvement in mean SO2 concentrations is about \$2333 or 1.4\% of mean housing price.},

  abstract = {Transport accounts for 24\% of global CO2 emissions from fossil fuels. Governments face challenges in developing feasible and equitable mitigation strategies to reduce energy consumption and manage the transition to low-carbon transport systems. To meet the local and global transport emission reduction targets, policymakers need more realistic/sophisticated future projections of transport demand to better understand the speed and depth of the actions required to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. In this paper, we argue that the lack of access to high-quality data on the current and historical travel demand and interdisciplinary research hinders transport planning and sustainable transitions toward low-carbon transport futures. We call for a greater interdisciplinary collaboration agenda across open data, data science, behaviour modelling, and policy analysis. These advancemets can reduce some of the major uncertainties and contribute to evidence-based solutions toward improving the sustainability performance of future transport systems. The paper also points to some needed efforts and directions to provide robust insights to policymakers. We provide examples of how these efforts could benefit from the International Transport Energy Modeling Open Data project and open science interdisciplinary collaborations.},

Using a difference-in-differences combined with propensity score matching framework, we find that metro systems have an economically significant positive effect on the urban GDP growth rate and that this effect is much larger for megacities with permanent populations of more than 6.15 million. Meanwhile, cross-city metro operations tend to increase economic concentrations in larger cities and expand GDP inequalities between cities connected by a cross-city metro. Our mechanism analyses further corroborate that a higher metro density has a positive effect on urban employment growth and a negative effect on the average wage of employees, but this does not improve urban total factor productivity (TFP), suggesting that a metro system is more likely to provide consumption amenities and employment access than it is to provide production amenities.},
