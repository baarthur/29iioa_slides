		"abstract": "Tourism is one of the most important sources of employment and income in some less developed Brazilian regions and, as it is not a traditional sector, accurate assessment of its impacts is scarce. Thus, the elaboration of indicators that help designing public policies aimed at this set of activities is essential for the development strategies of these regions. In this sense, this paper makes a first contribution by developing a methodology capable of introducing a specific sector for tourism in input-output matrices (IOM). Using an MIP and tourism satellite accounts for the economy of Ceará, a new MIP is built using the proposed methodology. An additional contribution of this paper is the pull index, capable of synthesizing the indices of forward and backward links, as well as their dispersions in a single result. The results obtained indicate that tourism has the fifth highest traction index, being the seventh sector in terms of employment and income multipliers.",

Amongst these, the tourist active comes detaching, a time that it feeds of all these approaching factors. Especially in some states that detach as receiving of Tourist with Fixed Residence in Portugal (TRFPs), as it is the case of Pernambuco. This work support itself in this reality to look for esteem the economic impacts of this tourist on the state. For in such a way, its expenses had been calculated and distributed amongst the state tourist subsectors, taking in account the geographic distribution, the daily average expenses and the time of permanence. After that, using a inputoutput boarding, the impacts on the production level, the income of the families, the level of job and on the sum of the added value, had been esteem for the state. The results had disclosed an influence superior, for example, to the GDP of important cities of Pernambuco.",

		"abstract": "This work aims to build the Input-Output Matrix for the touristic activity in the municipality of Campo Grande MS. Tourism is a social phenomenon that consists of the voluntary and temporary displacement of individuals or groups of people. The municipality stood out for ecotourism, one of the branches of this activity, which uses the natural and cultural heritage in a sustainable way, for the purpose of its conservation. The input-output matrix allows the identification of the impacts of each activity in relation to the entire economy. It was observed that the representativeness of the touristic activity for the municipality's economy is small, although through IOM, it can be inferred that with investments it could generate positive results for the municipality. Relevant is the Municipal Tourism Plan for the period from 2017 to 2027, however, without forecasting monetary values for investment in the activity for the development of local potential. Through IOM, it was observed that through a shock in specific sectors, it will result in impacts on job creation, remuneration and added value, both direct, indirect and induced.",
